	flow patterns throughout the Everglades. Pollen evidence indicates
	that pre-20th century vegetation at the sites consisted of sawgrass
	marshes in a peat-accumulating environment; these assemblages indicate
	moderate hydroperiods and water depths, comparable to those in modern
	sawgrass marshes of Everglades National Park. During the 20th century,
	vegetation changed to grassdominated marl prairies, and calcitic
	sediments were deposited, indicating shortening of hydroperiods and
	occurrence of extended dry periods at the site. These data suggest
	that the presence of marl prairies at these sites is a 20th century
	phenomenon, resulting from hydrologic changes associated with water

	soils only if the soils represent undisturbed field conditions, and
	2) volumetric expressions of water content are necessary to correctly
	evaluate the amount of water in a peat profile. The differences in
	physical properties were related to degree of decomposition as measured
	by bulk density and fibre content. Undecomposed peats with low bulk
	density and high fibre content contain many large pores which yield
	as much as 80 per cent of their saturated water content to drainage
	and permit rapid water movement. With increasing decomposition, fibre
	content decreases, resulting in increased bulk density and a greater
	proportion of small pores. The most decomposed peats yield less than
	10 per cent of their water to drainage and have very slow water movement
	rates.},

  abstract = {However, a major limitation of the model was the assumption of low
	hydraulic conductivity
	
	of the third geologic layer in which the bottom of the reservoir is
	assumed to be embedded.
	
	The model assumed a homogenous transmissivity of the third layer of
	212 feet per day
	
	(ft/day) (7.5 x 10-2 centimeters per second [cm/sec]) which is based
	on geologic borings
	
	conducted by the USGS in the 1960’s. The geology of
	
	the surficial aquifer system near the quarry site is characterized
	by peat and muck with poor
	
	natural drainage (Fish and Stewart, 1991) underlain by (from top to
	bottom) the oolitic and
	
	bryozoan limestone facies of Miami Oolite. The Miami Oolite is underlain
	by a series of
	
	highly weathered alternating shallow marine, brackish water and freshwater
	limestone facies
	
	of the Fort Thompson Formation (Causaras, 1987). The Fort Thompson
	formation in vicinity
	
	of the site is underlain by clastic and limestone units of Tamiami
	Formation and lower
	
	Hawthorn Formation which delineate the base of the surficial aquifer
	system in Dade County. It is the clastic units of the Tamiami Formation
	occurring from
	
	approximately 50 to 80 ft bls in the vicinity of the site which are
	the focus of this
	
	investigation.
	
	The grey clastic units of the Tamiami Formation generally consist
	of shelly, silty, calcareous
	
	sands (Causaras, 1987). The gray limestone, of the Tamiami Formation,
	is identified at
	
	depths of about 70 to 160 ft. bls and is lightly to moderately cemented.
	Fish and Stewart
	
	(1991) state that the gray limestone aquifer is defined as the part
	of the limestone beds and
	
	contiguous, very coarse, elastic beds that are highly permeable (e.g.,
	having hydraulic
	
	conductivity of about 100 ft/day [3.5 x 10-2 cm/sec] or greater).
	
	
	• Tamiami Formation;
	
	o Lower clastic unit of the Tamiami Formation;
	
	o Gray limestone of the Tamiami Formation (Gray Limestone Aquifer);
	
	o Upper clastic unit of the Tamiami Formation (semi confining unit);
	
	• Fort Thompson Formation (Biscayne Aquifer); and
	
	• Miami Oolite (Biscayne Aquifer).
	
	Several pumping tests were conducted by the USGS at well number G-3304
	which is located
	
	approximately two miles to the north of the proposed reservoir site.
	These tests indicated
	
	hydraulic conductivities of 40,000 (14 cm/sec) and 240 ft/day (8.4
	x 10-2 cm/sec) at intervals
	
	of 30-55 ft bls (Biscayne Aquifer) and 80-95.5 ft bls (Gray Limestone
	Aquifer), respectively.
	
	Review of boring logs presented in Wolf/WPC (2008), advanced approximately
	three miles to
	
	the north of the proposed reservoir, shows that the subsurface is
	generally characterized by
	
	weathered limestone at depths of approximately 30 ft bls to highly
	weathered limestone at
	
	depths of approximately 35 ft bls to 75 ft bls underlain by clayey
	loose sands (average 75 to
	
	80 ft bls) to poorly graded dense to medium dense sands with traces
	of clay and shells. Note
	
	that the characterization presented by Fish and Stewart (1991) is
	in general agreement with
	
	those presented in Wolf/WPC (2008) with the exception that the lower
	permeability material
	
	is encountered at 75 ft bls rather than the approximately 95 and 110
	ft bls as referenced by
	
	Fish and Stewart (1991). During this investigation, a pumping test
	was conducted on the
	
	interval between 17 and 72 ft bls in the Biscayne Aquifer which yielded
	a hydraulic
	
	conductivity of approximately 50,000 ft/day (18 cm/sec).},

  abstract = {Peat soils are formed when deposition of organic matter exceeds decomposition.
	This occurs when
	
	soils are wet or flooded for extended periods of time, which limits
	aerobic fungal and bacterial
	
	metabolism. In freshwater, flooded soils, methanogenesis dominates
	the decomposition process,
	
	which results in the accumulation of organic matter. Saltwater intrusion
	into soils previously fresh,
	
	introduces sulfate, an oxidant used by sulfate reducing bacteria,
	which may dramatically increase
	
	the rate of organic matter mineralization, lowering the surface elevation
	of the soil. Sulfate
	
	concentrations as low as 100uM/l are sufficient to initiate sulfate
	reduction. The peat complexes of
	
	the Everglades are at a particularly high risk to saltwater intrusion,
	whether caused by low
	
	freshwater flow, sea level rise or episodic storm surges, due to the
	low topographic relief of the
	
	southern portion of the Everglades. Sulfate reduction of peat soils
	has caused large scale change in
	
	at least one other estuary suddenly exposed to saltwater flooding,
	which may have important
	
	implications for the greater Everglades. However, there are many unknown
	variables relating to
	
	mineralization of various types of peat, including those found in
	the Everglades. There is an urgent
	
	need for research on the process of mineralization of peat soils found
	in the Everglades. These data
	
	need to be incorporated into existing models to understand how various
	scenarios of sea level rise
	
	and Everglades restoration will interact. Saltwater intrusion will
	initially impact the Everglades
	
	soils through Shark River and Taylor Sloughs, where research should
	be focused. There also needs
	
	to be an understanding of the role fringing mangrove systems will
	play in the ultimate rate of
	
	shoreline retreat. The key research questions relate to rates of peat
	degradation and biomass
	
	accumulation with saline water intrusion and how those rates impact
	surface elevations in the
	
	southern Everglades. There may be short and long term engineered solutions
	to consider, once a
	
	full understanding of rates and processes are known.},

  year = {2003},
  volume = {17},
  pages = {1227-1237},
  abstract = {A key parameter used in wetland hydrological and landform development
	models is hydraulic conductivity. Head recovery tests are often used
	to measure hydraulic conductivity, but the calculation techniques
	are usually confined to rigid soil theory. This is despite reports
	demonstrating the misapplication of rigid soil theory to non-rigid
	soils such as peats. Although values of hydraulic conductivity calculated
	using compressible techniques have been presented for fenland peats,
	these data have never, to the authors’ knowledge, been compared with
	such calculations in other peat types. Head recovery tests (slug
	withdrawal) were performed on piezometers at depths ranging from
	10 to 80 cm from the surface on north Pennines blanket peats. Results
	were obtained using both rigid and compressible soil theories, thus
	allowing comparison of the two techniques. Compressible soil theory
	gives values for hydraulic conductivity that are typically a factor
	of five times less than rigid soil calculations. Hydraulic conductivity
	is often assumed to decrease with depth in upland peats, but at the
	study site in the northern Pennines it was not found to vary significantly
	with depth within the range of peat depths sampled. The variance
	within depth categories was not significantly different to the variance
	between depth categories showing that individual peat layers did
	not have characteristic hydraulic conductivity values. Thus, large
	lateral and vertical differences in hydraulic conductivity over short
	distances create problems for modelling but may help account for
	the high frequency of preferential flow pathways within what is otherwise
	a low matrix hydraulic conductivity peat. Hydraulic conductivity
	was found to vary significantly between sampling sites, demonstrating
	that hillslope- or catchment-scale variability may be more important
	than plot-scale variability. Values for compressibility of the peats
	are also reported. These generally decline with depth, and they also
	vary significantly between sampling sites. There are implications
	for the way in which measurements of hydraulic conductivity and other
	properties of blanket peat are interpreted, as the effects of environmental
	change in one part of a peat catchment may be very different to those
	in another.},

	to an increase of surface runoff. From the relation between the moisture
	potential and water content, the solution for equilibrium water storage
	in the unsaturated zone and groundwater level is obtained. AS a result
	of experiments carried out on different soils it has been possible
	to determine the water yield and field capacity of the upper layer
	of 0.5 m for various drainage rates. It is known that on account
	of the rather large pore space of the shallow peats which are cultivated
	in the Polessie region, the summer precipitation is retained in the
	form of soil moisture within the saturated zone and hence no rise
	in the groundwater level occurs.},

  title = {Hydraulic Properties of South Florida Peat Lands},
  school = {University of Florida},

  type = {Master of Engineering},
  abstract = {This study examined the hydraulic properties of peat samples taken
	from isolated wetlands in southern Florida. The nature of peat soils
	affects wetland hydrology. Due to rapid development in the region,
	water resources managers are challenged to conserve wetlands while
	meeting human water needs. An extensive literature review was conducted
	to determine the extent of existing knowledge of peat, possible experimental
	methods, and procedures for data analysis. The physical properties
	of the samples, the transmission of water in the saturated condition,
	and the retention and release of water in the unsaturated condition
	were studied in laboratory experiments. Both sample collection and
	laboratory experiments employed unique equipment. Undisturbed peat
	samples were collected with a rotating device developed at the University
	of Florida. Experiments on saturated and unsaturated hydraulic properties
	were carried out using a two-tube apparatus designed by the author.
	Data from hydraulic conductivity experiments conducted in this apparatus
	fit an analytical model very closely and suggest that experimental
	error was very small. The apparatus also allowed the establishment
	of a water table at any level in order to conduct water balance experiments
	on an unsaturated sample. Because peats differ from mineral soils
	and from each other, the physical properties of the samples were
	characterized. Bulk density and ash content increased with depth,
	while effective porosity decreased with depth. Although the samples
	studied had ash contents ranging from about 25-90%, they behaved
	hydrologically as peats. Saturated hydraulic conductivities for the
	samples ranged from 7.3x10-6 cm/s to 3.0x10-4 cm/s. These values
	fall within ranges reported in the literature for pure peats. There
	was some evidence that the samples displayed a higher hydraulic conductivity
	in the upward flow direction than in the downward flow direction.
	Such behavior may enhance the ability of wetlands to maintain standing
	surface water when the groundwater table is low. Under unsaturated
	conditions, the ability of peat to hold water within its structure
	may help support wetland ecosystems. The peat samples released some
	water as the water table dropped, even at low tension heads. The
	height of capillary rise in the sand was an important factor affecting
	peat moisture. Although the peat maintained a water content of 30-40%
	even with a very deep water table, the residual water is not necessarily
	available to plants and would decrease further in the field due to
	evaporation. Following a change in water table height, soil moisture
	in the peat layer reached a new equilibrium distribution within a
	week or less. Pumping during drought periods should be managed so
	that the capillary fringe does not fall below the peat-sand interface
	any longer than this period.},

  abstract = {Results from 35 new test coreholes and aquifer-test, water-level,
	and water-quality data were combined with existing hydrogeologic
	data to define the extent, thickness, hydraulic properties, and degree
	of confinement of the gray limestone aquifer in southern Florida.
	This aquifer, previously known to be present only in southeastern
	Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties) below, and
	to the west of, the Biscayne aquifer, extends over most of centralsouth
	Florida, including eastern and central Collier County and southern
	Hendry County; it is the same as the lower Tamiami aquifer to the
	north, and it becomes the water-table aquifer and the upper limestone
	part of the lower Tamiami aquifer to the west. The aquifer generally
	is composed of gray, shelly, lightly to moderately cemented limestone
	with abundant shell fragments or carbonate sand, abundant skeletal
	moldic porosity, and minor quartz sand.
	
	The gray limestone aquifer comprises the Ochopee Limestone of the
	Tamiami Formation, and, in some areas, the uppermost permeable part
	of an unnamed formation principally composed of quartz sand. Underlying
	the unnamed formation is the Peace River Formation of the upper Hawthorn
	Group, the top of which is the base of the surficial aquifer system.
	Overlying the aquifer and providing confinement in much of the area
	is the Pinecrest Sand Member of the Tamiami Formation. The thickness
	of the aquifer is comparatively uniform, generally ranging from 30
	to 100 feet. The unnamed formation part of the aquifer is up to 20
	feet thick. The Ochopee Limestone accumulated in a carbonate ramp
	depositional system and contains a heterozoan carbonate-particle
	association. The principal rock types of the aquifer are pelecypod
	lime rudstones and floatstones and permeable quartz sands and sandstones.
	The pore types are mainly intergrain and separate vug (skeletal-moldic)
	pore spaces. The rock fabric and associated primary and secondary
	pore spaces combine to form a dual diffuse-carbonate and conduit
	flow system capable of producing high values of hydraulic conductivity.
	
	Transmissivity values of the aquifer are commonly greater than 50,000
	feet squared per day to the west of Miami-Dade and Broward Counties.
	Hydraulic conductivity ranges from about 200 to 12,000 feet per day
	and generally increases from east to west; an east-to-west shallowing
	of the depositional profile of the Ochopee Limestone carbonate ramp
	contributes to this spatial trend. The aquifer contains two areas
	of high transmissivity, both of which trend northwest- southeast.
	One area extends through southern Hendry County. The other area extends
	through eastern Collier County, with a transmissivity as high as
	300,000 feet squared per day; in this area, the aquifer is structurally
	high, the top of the aquifer is close to land surface, and it is
	unconfined to semiconfined. The confinement of the aquifer is good
	to the north and east in parts of southern Hendry, Palm Beach, Collier,
	Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties. In these areas, the upper confining
	unit approaches or is greater than 50 feet thick, and vertical leakance
	is less than 1.0 ´ 10-3 1/day.
	
	In most of the study area, the specific conductance in water from
	the gray limestone aquifer is 1,500 microsiemens per centimeter or
	less (chloride concentration of about 250 milligrams per liter or
	less). Areas where specific conductance is greater than 3,000 microsiemens
	per centimeter are found where there is a low horizontal-head gradient
	and the upper confining unit is greater than 50 feet thick. An area
	with specific conductance less than 1,500 microsiemens per centimeter
	extends from southern Hendry County to the southeast into western
	Broward County and coincides with an area of high transmissivity.
	However, much of this area has good confinement. The potentiometric
	gradient also is to the southeast in much of the area, and this area
	of low specific conductance is probably caused by a relatively rapid
	downgradient movement of fresh ground water that has been recharged
	in Hendry County.},

  abstract = {Southeastern Florida is an area that has been subject to widely conflicting
	anthropogenic stress to the Everglades and coastal ecosystems. This
	stress is a direct consequence of the 20th century economic competition
	for limited land and water resources needed to satisfy agricultural
	development and its expansion, its displacement by burgeoning urban
	development, and the accompanying growth of the limestone mining
	industry. The development of a highly controlled water-management
	system designed to reclaim land for urban and agricultural development
	has severely impacted the extent, character, and vitality of the
	historic Everglades and coastal ecosystems. An extensive conveyance
	system of canals, levees, impoundments, surface- water control structures,
	and numerous municipal well fields are used to sustain the present-day
	Everglades hydrologic system, prevent overland flow from moving eastward
	and flooding urban and agricultural areas, maintain water levels
	to prevent saltwater intrusion, and provide an adequate water supply.
	Extractive mining activities expanded considerably in the latter
	part of the 20th century, largely in response to urban construction
	needs.
	
	Much of the present-day urban-agricultural corridor of southeastern
	Florida lies within an area that is no more than 15 feet above NGVD
	1929 and formerly characterized by freshwater marsh, upland, and
	saline coastal wetland ecosystems. Miami- Dade, Broward, and Palm
	Beach Counties have experienced explosive population growth, increasing
	from less than 4,000 inhabitants in 1900 to more than 5 million in
	2000. Ground-water use, the principal source of municipal supply,
	has increased from about 65 Mgal/d (million gallons per day) obtained
	from 3 well fields in 1930 to more than 770 Mgal/d obtained from
	65 well fields in 1995. Water use for agricultural supply increased
	from 505 Mgal/d in 1953 to nearly 1,150 Mgal/d in 1988, but has since
	declined to 764 Mgal/d in 1995, partly as a result of displacement
	of the agricultural industry by urban growth. Present-day agricultural
	supplies are obtained largely from surface-water sources in Palm
	Beach County and ground-water sources in Miami-Dade County, whereas
	Broward County agricultural growers have been largely displaced.
	
	
	The construction of a complex canal drainage system and large well
	fields has substantially altered the surface- and ground-water hydrologic
	systems. The drainage system constructed between 1910 and 1928 mostly
	failed to transport flood flows, however, and exacerbated periods
	of low rainfall and drought by overdraining the surficial aquifer
	system. Following completion of the 1930s Hoover Dike levee system
	that was designed to reduce Lake Okeechobee flood flows, the Central
	and Southern Florida Flood Control Project initiated the restructure
	of the existing conveyance system in 1948 through canal expansion,
	construction of protective levees and control structures, and greater
	management of ground-water levels in the surficial aquifer system.
	
	
	Gated canal control structures discharge excess surface water during
	the wet season and remain closed during the dry season to induce
	recharge by canal seepage and well withdrawals. Management of surface
	water through canal systems has successfully maintained lower ground-water
	levels inland to curb urban and agricultural flooding, and has been
	used to increase ground-water levels near the coast to impede saltwater
	intrusion. Coastal discharge, however, appears to have declined,
	due in part to water being rerouted to secondary canals, and to induced
	recharge to the surficial aquifer system by large municipal withdrawals.
	
	
	Southeastern Florida is underlain by Holocene- to Tertiary-age karstic
	limestone deposits that form (in descending order): a highly prolific
	surficial aquifer system, a poorly permeable intermediate confining
	system, and a permeable Floridan aquifer system. Prior to construction
	of a complex drainage network, a widespread uppermost veneer of fresh
	wetland peat and muck deposits served to store water, maintained
	a higher water table (prolonging the Everglades hydroperiod), and
	ultimately helped to limit movement of the coastal saltwater interface.
	The highly permeable Biscayne aquifer, which is part of the surficial
	aquifer system, yields 1,000 to more than 7,000 gallons per minute
	to wells. By 2000, the Floridan aquifer system was used for aquifer
	storage and recovery and reverse osmosis at some sites in southern
	Florida, but primarily was used for wastewater injection purposes;
	the efficacy of such systems has been increasingly the subject of
	public scrutiny.
	
	Prior to construction of the drainage system, the ground-water table
	reflected Atlantic Coastal Ridge topography, and springs reportedly
	discharged as freshwater boils. Everglades surface waters discharged
	southward toward Florida Bay and in the transverse glade areas. The
	modern-day ground-water table reflects the effect of canal systems,
	levees, impoundments, and the drawdown effects of larger well fields.
	The saltwater interface forms a broad zone of diffusion, and its
	position is largely a function of lateral movement of seawater from
	the Atlantic Ocean, seepage from tidal canals, and upconing of relict
	seawater. Emplacement of conveyance and drainage canals, subsequent
	compaction and oxidation of inland peat and muck soils (which served
	previously to maintain higher water levels within the surficial aquifer
	system, including the Biscayne aquifer), and increased withdrawals
	from municipal supply wells collectively altered the natural balance
	between freshwater and saltwater considerably. Saltwater intrusion
	has been a concern in southeastern Florida since the early 1930s;
	its effects were most pronounced in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties
	during the 1940s and 1950s, respectively. Canal drainage appears
	to have had the most widespread impact on saltwater intrusion, lowering
	water levels in the surficial aquifer system and contributing to
	landward movement of the interface.
	
	Core sample paleontologic observations of salinity and the distribution
	of seagrass in Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay suggest that the coastal
	marine ecosystem system during the 20th century has been impacted
	considerably by anthropogenic activities. Land use and water-management
	practices have increased nutrient loads and other pollutants and
	increased bay turbidity. Prior to 1900, the Biscayne Bay ecosystem
	was characterized by much lower marine salinities, including the
	extreme southern part of the bay, which contained waters that were
	nearly fresh. Consistent with the progressive inland saltwater intrusion
	into the surficial aquifer system and the Biscayne aquifer, the increase
	in salinity interpreted for surface- and groundwater resources in
	the early 1900s through the 1970s is the result of increased urban
	development and construction of a canal drainage system. Post-1940
	water-management practices to control water discharge greatly affected
	the Biscayne Bay ecosystem by increasing the frequency, and particularly
	the magnitude of salinity fluctuations in the 1940s. Clearly, the
	changes in land use and water-management practices over the long
	term have had a profound effect on the ground-water hydrology of
	southeastern Florida.},

	without vegetation produced highly uncertain parameters and were
	limited to a relatively small pressure head range. Better results
