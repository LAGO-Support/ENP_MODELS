;**********************************
;RR-Variables no 1: 
;    The initial loss capacity is regenerated in dry periods by a linear
;    recovery rate. Default value is 0.00005 [m/hour].
;    The rate can be controled by the parameter RUNOFF_B_INITLOSS_RECOVER
;
; RR-Variables no 2:
;    A correction of the time-unit used to calculated infiltration losses in Urban Model B
;    causes differences in results between previous versions and the present (Hotfix for Rel2008 SP2)
;    Changing the variable; RUNOFF_B_INFILTRATIONCALC_PRIOR2008SP2 to ON re-activates the previous
;    formulation if required for compatibility reasons.          Date implemented: 15/7-2008
;
; RR-Variables no 3:
;    A correction of the conditions when to change mode from 'Dry-Horton mode' to Wet-Horton mode'
;    is included in release 2009 SP4. This correction will for some applications result in difference
;    results and a backwater compatibility switch is available to revert to the previous formulation
;
; RR-Variables no 4:
;    The Extended Snow model of NAM (including snow zones) has original been developed with an assumption
;    that when snow depth are less than 1 mm (almost no snow) then the snow coverage has been defined as
;    a fixed value of 5 percent which was kept through out the simulation for small snow depths.
;    The present variable allows this assumption to be switched off and allow the zones to become completely
;    free of snow (coverage set to zero pct) when snow depth in actual zone is equal to zero.
;
;RR-Variables no 5:
;    When simulating HD and RR simultanously a RR timestep multiplier is possible to define.
;    SP1 for Release 2016 has corrected an issue for this case when the RR-calculation is active and different
;    from 1, which may cause slight difference in results.
;    A backward compatibility parameter has been introduced that will bring back the solution to prior SP1 for Rel2016
;      RR_SOLUTION_PRIOR_REL2016=OFF  (set to ON to activate previous solution)

;**     MIKE 11 HD SETTINGS      **
;**********************************
;
; HD-Variables no 1:
;    Flow-directions used when applying Wind stress in a HD-simulation is
;    calculated automatically during reading of input data. The calculated
;    flow directions is saved in a ASCII file named 'FLOWDIR.TXT' by activating
;    the variable:
;       CREATE_FLOWDIR_FILE       Value : ON/OFF
;
;    In case the calculated flow-directions needs to be modified the user can
;    manually edit the text-file 'FLOWDIR.TXT' and activate the variable:
;       FLOWDIR_FROM_FILE	       Value : ON/OFF
;    By activating this variable, MIKE 11 HD will read and utilise flow-directions
;    from the ASCII text-file.
;
; HD-Variables no 2:
;    Previous versions of MIKE 11 (before version 4.01) only included the
;    Divide section feature (Cross section database) in Sediment Transport
;    morphological simulations.
;    Version 4.01 can utilise this feature also in pure HD-simulation.
;    Activate / de-activated by setting the variable:
;        DIVIDE_FLP_AND_RIVER_IN_HDSIMUL  Values  : ON/OFF
;
; HD-Variables no 3:
;    Max. Depth exceedance.
;    The exceedance of water level above any cross section bank-levels during
;    a simulation can be controlled by adjusting the variable:
;        WL_EXCEEDANCE_FACTOR (Default = 4)
;
; HD-Variables no 4:
;    Coefficient for centering iterative calculation of sub-merged discharge.
;    Default value is 0.5, corresponding to full centering the previous and the
;    most recently calculated value. Only values between 0.5 and 1.0 allowed.
;        STRUCTURE_ITERATION_CENTERING=0.5
;
; HD-Variables no 5:
;    After reading of input files, non-critical errors may occur in some of the
;    input data. These warnings are informed to the user by a messagebox, and a
;    user action is required to continue the simulation.
;    To avoid this user action, it is possible to switch off the appearance of
;    the warnings messagebox with the below variable. (Values: ON/OFF)
;        SHOW_WARNING_MESSAGEBOX=ON
;
; HD-Variables no 6:
;    Variable defining the maximum allowable number of iterations during one
;    time step in situations where one or several control structures are
;    solved using the iterative calculation mode. Default value is 50.
;        MAX_GATE_ITERATIONS=50
;
; HD-Variables no 7:
;    A new and improved structure solution has been implemented.
;    In some situations results close to the structure can be different
;    from results obtained using the previous structure solution. To keep
;    using the old solution this variable should equal ON. Default is OFF
;    meaning that the new solution is used.
;        OLD_STRUCTURE_SOLUTION=OFF
;
; HD-Variables no 8:
;    Transition from critical to subcritical flow through submerged underflow
;    structures is discontinuous in nature. To avoid numerical problems
;    the 'SUBMERGED_UNDERFLOW_COEFFICIENT' is introduced to make a smooth
;    transition. Default value is 0.0. If the value is increased the transition
;    is made less abrupt. This coefficient only works when OLD_STRUCTURE_SOLUTION
;    is equal to OFF.
;        SUBMERGED_UNDERFLOW_COEFFICIENT=0.00
;
; HD-Variables no 9:
;    Discharge through bridges is precalculated.
;    Variables defining up- and downstream grid size for precalculated tables.
;    Default value 0.1 = 0.1 meter.
;        BRIDGE_TABLE_GRID_UPSTREAM=0.1
;        BRIDGE_TABLE_GRID_DOWNSTREAM=0.1
;
;    Variable defining maximum number of iterations for precalculating tables.
;    	 BRIDGE_TABLE_MAX_ITERATIONS=50
;
; HD-Variables no 10:
;    Bridges using the FHWA method for submergence uses per default two orifice
;    equations for submergence.
;    0 : No orifice equation is used
;    1 : Only submerged orifice equation used
;    2 : Both submerged orifice (downstream) and non-submerged orifice equation.
;    Default value
;        BRIDGE_ORIFICE_FLOW=2
;
;    The reach length for the FHWA method is determined based on an equal
;    conveyance tube analysis. If the reach length should only be based on
;    the physical distance from the adjacent cross section to the bridge
;    the variable 'USE_FHWA_REACH_LENGTH' may be used.
;
;    Default value
;        USE_FHWA_REACH_LENGTH = ON
;
; HD-Variables no 11:
;    The velocity distribution coefficient for bridge calculations is set to
;    unity per default.
;    The coefficient may be calculated based on conveyance distribution.
;    To do the latter the variable 'USE_ALPHA' may be used.
;
;    Default value
;       USE_ALPHA = OFF
;
; HD-Variables no 12:
;    When the h-Q-h relations calculated for bridges a filter may be applied.
;    There are three different filters available. Whether or not a
;    a filter is applied is controlled by the variables 'SMOOTH_BRIDGE_SURFACE'
;    and 'SMOOTH_BRIDGE_SURFACE_LOOPS'. The first variable takes values in the
;    range 0-3 where
;
;    0   : No filter
;    1-3 : Filters with different weights on adjacent terms in the grid
;
;    The second variable controls the number of times the filter is applied.
;    The greater the value the smoother the h-Q-h relation.
;
;    Default values
;       SMOOTH_BRIDGE_SURFACE = 0
;       SMOOTH_BRIDGE_SURFACE_LOOPS = 0
;
; HD-Variables no 13:
;    The generation of h-Q-h relations for bridges may be time consuming.
;    The h-q-h relation may be read from a previous run. To achieve this the
;    preprocessed file(s) need to be present in the working directory
;    (the location of the sim11 file).
;    To enable this feature the variable 'BRIDGE_PREPROCESSED' should be set to
;    ON.
;    Further the format of the preprocessed files should also be specified.
;    The two formats available are 'ASCII' and 'DFS2'. The format is set using
;    the variable 'BRIDGE_FILE_FORMAT'.
;
;
;    Default values
;       BRIDGE_PREPROCESSED = OFF
;       BRIDGE_FILE_FORMAT = DFS2
;
; HD-Variables no 14:
;    At low flow conditions a slot is introduced. The amount of water in this
;    slot may be included in the calculation of the mass error by setting this
;    variable to ON. This setting has no effect on the rest of the simulation
;    only on the mass error calculation for water levels in the slot.
;    Default is OFF.
;    SLOT_VOLUME_CORRECTION = OFF
;
;
; HD-Variables no 15:
;    The critical discharge calculation over a broadcrested weir is part of the
;    neccesarry preprocessing of data. The critical discharge is found as
;    an integration of the local critcal velocity over the whole weir cross
;    sectional area. This integration may either be carried out numerically
;    using the trapezoidal rule or analytically using linear interpolation
;    between data points. The latter is achived by setting
;    WEIR_QH_CALC_NUM_INTEGRATE to OFF. Earlier versions of MIKE11 used the
;    former integration i.e. numerical integration. Thus to ensure backward
;    compatebility this switch should be set to ON. Default is ON. Also note
;    that to make this setting work the MIKE11.INI file MUST be located in the
;    WINDOWS directory.
;    WEIR_QH_CALC_NUM_INTEGRATE=ON
;
; HD-Variables no 16:
;    Variable used to fade out the effect of the momentum eqaution for low
;    flow conditions. Default is on.
;    QZERO_METHOD=ON
;
; HD-Variables no 17:
;    Variable used to implement an area preserving slot for low
;    flow conditions. CAUTION is recomended when using this facility since it
;    may give rather servere restrictions on the time-step in a simulation. The
;    gain being that the cross sectional area used for the computations varies
;    continously across the level at which the slot is introduced.
;    Default is off.
;    AREA_PRESERVING_SLOT=OFF
;
; HD-Variables no 18:
;    Variable used in connection with the 'Tripple Zone Approach' for
;    bed resistance specification in the HD Parameter file.
;    Variable BEDRES_TRANSFER_INTERVAL defines the depth below the zone divider
;    where a cosine transfer function is activated to go from one zone's bed
;    resistance value to another zones value.
;
; HD-Variables no 19:
;    Variable used to activate lateral outflow corrections. For low flow
;    conditions this initiates a check on the amount of water available before
;    extraction through a lateral outflow. If a possible lateral outflow demand
;    cannot be met a warning is issued at the end of the simulation along
;    with the total unsatisfied demand (volume of water for the whole period).
;    Default is ON.
;
; HD-Variables no 20:
;    Variable used to revert back to the 1999b version. When
;    1999B_REVERSABILITY is ON the 1999b version will be used.
;    Default value is OFF.
;
; HD-Variables no 21:
;    Variable used to change license control system from network license
;    system back to previous used local DHILicense.Dat licensesystem
;
;HD-Variables no 22-27

;      KWRouting_KK=6            Kinematic Wave channel routing: Division of Timestep
;      NLSF_Error1=0.01          Non linear storage function: Criterion for error for 'SQCurv'
;      NLSF_Error2=0.01          Non linear storage function: Criterion for error for 'NLSF'
;      NLSF_IR1=100              Non linear storage function: Number of iterations for 'SQCurv'
;      NLSF_IR2=50               Non linear storage function: Number of iterations for 'NLSF'
;      NGD_Error=0.001           Non gate discharge method: Criterion for error
;      NGD_IBUN=1                Non gate discharge method: Number of divisions for time step
;
;HD-Variables no 28:

;   hydrodynamic simulations using lateral inflows from SHE.
;   Default value: LATERAL_INFLOW_FROM_RESULT_FILE=OFF

;HD-Variables no 30:
;   Temporary switch for defining language in Engine. Final implementation will make simulation
;   editor able to send info about current language version.
;   Present Language-types available:
;      0 : Standard/Default - working as all previous releases of English versions
;      1 : Japanese/MultiByteCharacterSet version - Case sensitivity on strings filenames etc. activated!
;   LANGUAGE_VERSION=0

;HD-Variables no 31:

; HD-Variables no 32:
;    Switch between radius formulations in QSSVEG:
;    1: As requested by CTI (based on integrated y^5/3)
;    2: Resistance radius as default in M11 (based on integrated y^3/2)
;    3: Hydraulic radius (R=A/P)
;       Default: QSSVEG_RADIUS=3
;

; HD-Variables no 33:
;    Switch between suppression strategies of convective terms in QSSVEG:
;    1: The Froude number is calculated for each of the panels upstream
;       and downstream and the maximum of these Froude numbers is used
;       for determining the suppression factor.
;    2  A suppression factor is calculated and used for each panel upstream
;       and downstream. Thus the suppression factor is specific to each panel
;       in the cross sections.
;    3  No suppression is applied to the convective terms.
;       Caution is recommended when using this possibility since it may cause
;       severe numerical instability.
;
;       Default: QSSVEG_SUPPRESSION_STRATEGY=1

; HD-Variables no 34:
;    To increase the numerical stability of the algorithm an upstream
;    centering of the friction terms may be applied.
;    Default: QSSVEG_CENTERING_FRICTION=OFF

; HD-Variables no 35:
;  Please note that when utilizing the quasi two dimensional steady state
;  with vegetation module, additional data can be obtained by setting the
;  following switch: CREATE_QSSVEG_VELOCITY_FILE=ON
;  With this setting 8 .txt-files are generated and saved in the working

; increment is to be added.
;
;     Default:   LIMIT_ON_QSSVEG_CURVATURE_CALC = 10

; HD-Variables no 37:
;    To increase the numerical stability of the algorithm an upstream
;    an alternative method of applying the convective supression may be applied
;    when using the higher order fully dynamic or the fully dynamic wave
;    approximtion.
;    Default: ALTERNATIVE_CONV_SUPPR_FOR_FULLY_DYNAMIC=OFF

;HD-Variables no 39:
;    Updates in the structure solution from version 2002 can cause differences in results
;    when comparing with Version 2001x and previously releases. The old method can be re-activated
;    by activating this variable.
;    Default: 2001B_STRUC-REVERSABILITY=OFF

;    ALLOW8087CHANGES=OFF
;
; HD-Variables no 43:
;    If (lateral) abstraction of water from the river is larger than volume available in actual timestep
;    the default approach applied by MIKE 11 is to reduce the amount of water abstracted and thereby ensure
;    that the water level at the abstraction point does not go below the river bottom level.
;    To ensure a minimum of water in the river downstream of the abstraction point it is possible to define
;    an alternative solution method where either a minimum depth or a minimum flow at the abstraction
;    point is kept throughout the simulation.
;    The variable; TARGET_METHOD_FOR_DRYOUT_BY_LATERAL_ABSTRACTION defines which method is to be adapted
;        Options are:
;            0 : Keep original solution method (avoiding water level goes below bottom level)
;            1 : Define a minimum water depth at the abstraction point  (Minimum depth defined in meters)
;            2 : Define a minimum discharge at the abstraction point    (Minimum discharge defined in m3/s)

;      TARGET_VALUE_IF_DRYOUT_BY_LATERAL_ABSTRACTION=0.05

;HD-Variables no 44:
;    When a radial gate is lifted above the water a different equation is used to
;    describe the flow than the one used when the gate is submerged.
;    To avoid numerical problems when this happens
;    the 'RADIALGATETRANSITION' is introduced to make a smooth

;    RADIALGATETRANSITION=0.05


;HD-Variables no 45:
;    The Zeta Min specified in the HD 11 file was previously applied to
;    each of the losses occuring at structures. Presently Zeta Min is applied to
;    the total loss across a structure. If the user wants to reverse to the old
;    iterpretation of Zeta Min then the variable OLDZETAMINMETHOD should equal ON
;    Default value is OFF.

;HD-Variables no 46:
;    The variable; 'damp_vel_xz' dampen longitudinal flow oscillations in the
;    XZ-model.

;HD-Variables no 47:

;    Improves solution especially for dry/low flow situations

;HD-Variables no 48:
;   QSS_Convergence_Criteria_Method is a switches between convergence criteria methods applied in

;HD-Variables no 49
;   Additional Resultfile Output item 'Bed Shear Stress' has originally been implemented using the
;   Energy Line slope in the formulation instead of the most commonly applied friction slope.
;   The default formulation for calculating Bed Shear Stress has been changed (from Release 2008, SP2)
;   to use the normal Friction Slope in the calculation - thus substituting the previous formulation.
;   The parameter; 'AddOutput_ShearStress_UseEnergyLevelSlope' can be used to revert to the previous
;   formulation for Bed Shear Stress calculation using the Energy Line slope
;   Values
;     AddOutput_ShearStress_UseEnergyLevelSlope=OFF   => Friction slope is used for Bed Shear Stress calc.
;     AddOutput_ShearStress_UseEnergyLevelSlope=ON    => Energy line slope is used for Bed Shear Stress calc.

;HD-Variables no 50
;   Alternative approach for calculating the resulting cross section for limiting sections in dam break
;   Values
;     AlternativeLimitingSection=ON    => Use New, improved approach for calculating limiting cross section in DB

;HD-Variable no 51
;   Distances between cross sections are checked and validated during pre-processing. If distances between sections
;   are found less than 0.20 meter the simulation will stop with an error.
;   The current variable will switch the validation routine on or off. Default is ON
;   ValidateDistanceBetweenCrossSections=ON
;
;HD-Variable no 52
;   Version 2009, SP2 includes a significant correction of a water balance problem for model-setups utilising
;   one of the Muskingum Routing formulations. It has been found that these routing options in models where
;   Lateral inflow is included (such as in coupled MIKE SHE - MIKE 11 models) can introduce significant
;   mass errors. This problem has been solved but to allow to reproduce previous model-setups utilising these
;   features a backward compatibility switch has been introduced.
;   Default: MuskingumRouting_LateralInflow_PriorV2009SP2=OFF
;
;HD-Variable no. 54
;   2DMapping feature has been updated with respect to interpolation at points between cross sections with bank-coordinates.
;   Improvement can potentially create significant different maps and a reversability variable is therefore included as part of this development.
;   The variable; MappingPriorRelease2009SP3 can be defined as either ON or OFF  (Default = OFF which means that the new method is active per default.
;      MappingPriorRelease2009SP3=OFF
;
;HD-Variable no. 55
;   2-D Mapping feature:
;      Minimum Distance between mapping box section lines created from digitisation points.
;   Per default, mapping boxes are generated at every single h-point and every single digitisation point in the network file.

;    Choose how often the Kalman filter update should be carried out
;        Default: UPDATE_FREQUENCY = 1 (update every timestep)

; DA-variables no 2:
;    Switch for applying exponential smoothing for the Kalman Gain
;        Default: USE_K_GAIN_SMOOTHING = ON

; DA-variables no 3:
;    Coefficient for exponential smoothing of Kalman Gain. Takes values in the closed
;    interval [0,1]. In principle 0 corresponds to "no smoothing", 1 corresponds to
;    using the Kalman Gain from the previous time step
;        Default: K_GAIN_SMOOTHING_COEFF = 0.95

; DA-variables no 4:
;    A switch that enables the user to control whether the sequences of random numbers
;    generated by the DA module should be reproducible or not. 'ON' gives reproducible
;    sequences based on the seeds specified in DA-variables no. 5 and 6. 'OFF' makes
;    the program generate two random seeds.
;        Default: USER_DEFINED_SEEDS = ON

; DA-variables no 5:
;    User specified value for seeding the random sequence that the DA module
;    generates for HD and AD boundaries. The seed must be a negative integer.
;        Default: HD_AD_SEED = -10000

;    User specified value for seeding the random sequence that the DA module
;    generates for RR boundaries. The seed must be a negative integer.
;        Default: RR_SEED = -10010

; DA-Variables no. 6:
;    When updating - especially during low flow - occasionally the model simulations become unstable
;    and the simulation will terminate. However, to allow a continuous, automatic run of on-line forecasting
;    systems an option is available such that MIKE 11 will automatically search for update points at locations
;    in vicinity of calculation points which has become unstable.
;    After disabling the closest update point an automatic simulation is re-started without updating at the
;    specific location. If update point is disabled, a message is written to the MIKE 11 log-file.
;    Variable:
;         ALLOW_UPDATE_POINTS_DISABLING_AND_REPEAT_SIMULATION=ON/OFF
